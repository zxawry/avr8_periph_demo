Title: avr8_periph_demo

Brief:
	There in nothing too fancy here. Just me dabbling with an ATmega8A and
	testing out different peripherals.

Desc v0.0.1:
	So far, I have hooked up a DS1307 RTC module and a SSD1306 display to
	the MCU. As you can guess, it's going to be a digital clock, fairly
	simple as that. In order to set time and other dynamic settings, I have
	used the serial interface (USART as in the datasheet). I tried my best
	to implement most of the things using interrupts instead of lame polling
	functions. However, at the end I resorted to polling some global flags
	which are only set within ISRs and reset during the main loop.

Desc v0.0.2:
	Well, I am so amazed by the flawless performance of this DS18B20 chip.
	For one thing, it only uses one single wire for communications and it
	occured to me that countless trials are expected for a clean read-out
	due to noisy signals and all. However, I was proved wrong with smooth
	temperature read-outs, respecting the recommanded delay durations in the
	datasheet, of course. Now, I have the current temperature displayed along
	with the date and time from pervious version.
