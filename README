# avr8_periph_demo

There in nothing too fancy here. Just me dabbling with an ATmega8A and testing
out different peripherals.

So far, I have hooked up a DS1307 RTC module and an SSD1306 display to the MCU.
As you can guess, it's going to be a digital clock, fairly simple as that. For
setting time and stuffs on it, I have used the serial port or USART as the
datasheet calls it. I tried my best to implement most of the things using
interrupts instead of polling methods. However, at the end I resorted to polling
some flags that are only set within ISRs and reset during the main loop.
